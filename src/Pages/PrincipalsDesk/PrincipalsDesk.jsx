              The long held idiom “reaching for the moon” was a dream realized
              as India’s Chandrayan 3 landed on the south pole of the lunar
              surface at 6.03 pm on August 23, 2023. Year 2023 will always be
              remembered for the remarkable achievement of India completing this
              space odyssey. Early 2024, ISRO could also successfully insert
              Aditya L1 solar observatory into Halo orbit around the sun-earth
              point L1.In fact, ISRO’s missions taught all of us how to aim for
              the stars believing in our own abilities and learning from
              failures. We are also proud of our DRDO scientists for Mission
              Divyastra, the first flight test of indigenously developed Agni-5
              missile with Multiple Independently Targetable Re-entry Vehicle
              (MIRV) technology.

              India’s space sector achievements emphasize the significance of
              core engineering fields and hope this will sow the seeds of change
              in mindset of engineering students to choose courses for their
              study accordingly. The celebration of the Chandrayan Mahotsav on
              4th September by our first year students inspired them to think in
              this direction.
